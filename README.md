# GreenDriveChallenge
A social responsibility project for green. Developed in Ford Otosan Hackathon.

To increase the awareness of CO2 emissions, our project aims to have an impact. Such as iceBucketChallenge and alike, people can challenge other via link, getting scores about how they drive "green", and shares it.
